		<h3> Dinner  (July 28) </h3><br><br>
    
    There will be a social dinner at the Bengal Brasserie, 5 Merrion Way, Leeds City Centre, LS2 8BT (<a href="https://www.bengal-brasserie.com/leeds-city-centre/">link to webpage</a>) on Thursday the 28th of July, 7:30pm. We have already informed the restaurant of the various dietary restrictions we have collected from the registered participants, and they said they can accommodate them. The standard menu will consist of a fixed 3-course meal including poppadoms and starters for each person; a vegetable dish, a chicken dish and a lamb dish for each table, together with some side dishes, rice, and naans. Those with dietary restrictions will have to identify themselves to the personnel upon entrance. (&pound;20.00, drinks not included)<br><br>

We will ensure space for everyone who books the dinner by July 18.
