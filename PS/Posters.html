		<h3> Posters </h3><br><br>
  
 
 
 
   
   Every participant of the workshop, and especially if at early stage, is welcome to present a poster. The posters will be fixed in the MALL and will be visible for the entire duration of the workshop. We will allocate one hour of the program specifically for people to visit that room and interact with the poster contributors, as per program. If you bring a poster, please hand it to the organisers when registering on the first morning.<br><br>

<b> Note:</b> A big number of participants are also attending the summer school preceding the PS workshop and present a poster there. Their posters will automatically be transferred to the poster room of the PS workshop. You do NOT need to take any further action if you belong to that category.<br><br>

 
<img src="new.png"style="width:50px;height:50px">   Anyone wishing their poster to be uploaded on the website, please email it to the organisers by Sunday 24/07 at 6pm.<br><br><br>
