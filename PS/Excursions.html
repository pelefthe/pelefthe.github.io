<img src="new.png"style="width:50px;height:50px">  There have not been enough registrations for the excursions to York and to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, and hence we are cancelling them. Those who have paid for them will be refunded, within a week, on the credit/debit card they used when booking.



We will instead depart with all those registered for, or now willing to join, the hike through the Meanwood Valley Trail to the Myrtle Tavern, from the School of Mathematics on Wednesday 27th at 14:00. All this is weather permitting.<br><br>

We hope you get another chance to go to York during your stay in Leeds. If so, <a href="https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtpe/PS/York.html">here</a> is a short description and list of recommendations.<br><br><br>
 
			
		<h3> Excursions (July 27) </h3><br><br>
   
  <b> OUTDATED.</b> The excursions will start from the steps of the Parkinson Building of the university campus (<b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1-f1HQd4tTsm8tUtG-jhoPwXbf6K6tXY&ll=53.80693949815302%2C-1.5564775999999902&z=17">see map</a></b>) at 13:45, July 27, and end at the same place around 19:00-19:30. <br><br>

The first two excursions below require coaches which we have already booked, and have capacity of 31 seats each. Your reservation will be on a first-come first-served basis. In case of less than 20 registered participants for either coach, or in case of rainy weather, we may cancel any of the three excursions and your payment will be returned.

Below are some brief descriptions of the three excursions (thanks to the Leeds PhD students for providing them!):


		<p><b>Coach Trip to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park (<a href="https://ysp.org.uk/">link</a>):</b> The Yorkshire Sculpture Park is an open-air gallery located about 40 minutes away from Leeds by bus, showing work by British and international artists, including Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. This trip offers a great opportunity for some local culture! (&pound;14.00, including the entrance ticket)
   
   

		<p><b>Coach Trip to York (<a href="https://www.visityork.org/">link</a>):</b> York is one of the most picturesque towns in the north of England, around 50 minutes away from Leeds by bus. We will offer recommendations for nice restaurants and pubs as well as local attractions. A great choice for those who are interested in beautiful architecture and nice beer! (&pound;10.00, drinks not included)

		<p><b>Hiking Trip to Myrtle Tavern (<a href="https://myrtletavern.co.uk/">link</a>):</b> An hour and 20 mins (but not very demanding) hiking trip from the centre of Leeds through the beautiful <a href="https://meanwoodvalleytrail.co.uk/">Meanwood trail</a>  and forest ending in a traditional British pub / beer garden. A great choice for those who are feeling more adventurous and want to explore the beautiful Yorkshire countryside! (free, drinks not included)
