<li><b> Elias Baro (Madrid)</b>: <i>Small groups definable in dense pairs of real closed fields</i> 
<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> A. Robinson proved the completeness of the theory of real closed fields (rcf) with a predicate for a proper dense real closed subfield. L. van den Dries later gave a characterization of definable sets and definable functions in dense pairs of rcf (in fact, of o-minimal expansions of ordered groups). A notion of "small" set played a crucial role. Roughly, a small set is the image of the predicate by a semialgebraic map. Recently, E. Pantelis has proved that any definable small set is, up to interdefinability, a subset of the predicate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the paper "Small groups in dense pairs" (arXiv:1801.08744), we show that every small group definable in a dense pair of rcf has locally, up to interdefinability, an algebraic group law. In this talk I will present this result, which is a joint work with A. Martín-Pizarro.

Alex Bernstein (Los Andes):</b> <i>Definable groups in dense pairs of geometric theories</i>
<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> Let M be a geometric structure and let G be a group definable in M. The goal of this talk is to study the definable subgroups of G in an expansion of M by a dense/codense subset. We show that under some tame assumptions, if G is definably amenable, then  it remains definably amenable in the expansion. We also show that under mild assumptions the connected component G^00  in the expansion agrees with the connected component G^00 in the original language.

<br><br>

<b> Abstract:</b> In this talk I will discuss the expansion of geometric theories by a predicate that satisfies certain properties. Namely, the subset which the predicate defines is the universe of a model for some theory T' that interacts with the theory T of the larger structure in desirable ways. This framework generalizes the work of van den Dries on dense pairs of models of an o-minimal theory, the work of Hieronymi, Nell, and Walsberg on o-minimal structures with a dense predicate interpreting an arbitrary theory, and the work on lovely pairs of geometric structures developed by Berenstein and Vassilev. This is joint work with Philipp Hieronymi and Elliot Kaplan.

<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will discuss some progress made towards classifying expansions of the real field by finitely generated subgroups of the complex numbers by their definable sets.

<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> 

We consider a dp-minimal (not strongly minimal) theory $T$, expanding
the theory of fields of characteristic 0. We assume it admits quantifier
elimination (in some relational expansion $\cL$ of the language of
fields), we consider its expansion $T_D$ to a theory of differential
fields.
Under some natural hypotheses, it is known that the class of
existentially closed models of such expansions is elementary and that
its theory $T_{D}^*$ admits quantifier elimination in $L_{\delta}$ (the
language $\cL$ to which we add the derivation $\delta$). In particular,
in any model of $T^*_D$, we get a dense pair of models of $T$.
We will first review a number of known transfer results between $T$ and
$T_D^*$ and their consequences for the theory of dense pairs of models
of $T$. Then we will concentrate on elimination of imaginaries (e.i.).
In the case of CODF, there are now several proofs (of e.i.), for
instance one using the description of definable types.
We will show transfer of elimination of imaginaries between $T$ and
$T^*_D$, using a topological argument due to M. Tressl in the case of
the theory of closed ordered fields.

<b>Abstract:</b> Every reasonable notion of “smallness” for definable subsets of a first-order structure (satisfying an additional "definability" assumption) can be made to coincide with “being countable”.

Ayhan Gunaydin (Bogazici):</b> <i>Tame Expansions of o-minimal Structures</i>


<a href="http://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~eleftheriou/tame/Ayhan.pdf"> <b>NOTES</b> </a>


<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> Expanding a model theoretically “tame” structure in a way that it stays “tame” has been a theme in the recent years. After presenting a brief history of work done in that frame, we focus on the case of expansions of o-minimal structures by a dense unary predicate. Starting from a set of abstract axioms, we obtain a decomposition theorem for definable sets and a local structure theorem for definable groups.<br>

 The abstract axioms mentioned above are “smallness”, “o-minimal open core” and “quantifier elimination up to existential formulas”. We shall illustrate several consequences of these axioms.<br>

<li><b> Omar Leon Sanchez (Manchester):</b> <i> On differentially large fields and a bit on CODF's</i>
<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> Recall that a field K is large if it is existentially closed in K((t)). Examples of such fields are the complex, the real, and the p-adic numbers. This class of fields has been exploited significantly in inverse Galois-theoretic problems. In recent work with M. Tressl we introduced a differential analogue of largeness, that we conveniently call ''differentially large''. I will present some properties of such fields, and use a twisted version of the Taylor morphism to characterise them using formal Laurent series. Examples of such fields are CODFs (closed ordered differential fields). At the end of the talk I will present some recent results with P. Eleftheriou and N. Regnault showing that large-dimension coincides with differential-dimension on sets definable in the dense pair (R,C) for R a CODF and C its constants. I will finish with an open question...
The talk that follows, given by M. Tressl, will focus on further properties of CODFs, and uses some of the tools mentioned in my talk.

<li><b> Travis Nell (UIUC):</b>  <i>Distality in Pairs</i>

<a href="http://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~eleftheriou/tame/Nell.pdf"> <b>SLIDES</b> </a>

<br><br>  

<b>Abstract:</b> The notion of distality attempts to isolate the notion of a purely unstable behavior in an NIP theory. I will examine certain cases of expansions of o-minimal structures by a unary predicate. Each of these examples will be non-distal. In the case that the predicate is a proper, dense elementary substructure, I will characterize the distal types. In the case of the expansion of an ordered divisible abelian group and the predicate is a dense independent set, I will talk about how to find a distal expansion of this structure.

Alex Savatovsky (Konstanz):</b> <i>Expansions of the real field which
introcuce no new C^infinity functions</i>
<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> We will give a rough sketch of the following theorem: Let L be the language of field and P be a predicate. Let R be an RCF and (R,P) a d-minimal structure.  Under some model theoretic assumptions, we have that  every  definable C^infinity function  on  an  open  connected  domain  is  the restriction of some L-definable function to this domain.

</i>


<a href="http://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~eleftheriou/tame/Athipat.pdf"> <b>SLIDES</b> </a>


<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> The concept of cell decomposition theorem in d-minimal context was proposed by Chris
Miller. In this talk, we prove that the cell decomposition theorem holds in d-minimal
expansions of the real field.

Marcus Tressl (Manchester):</b> <i>Closed ordered differential fields.
</i>
<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> 
A closed ordered differential field (CODF) is an existentially closed model
in the class of ordered fields expanded by a derivation. CODFs have been introduced by Michael Singer in 1978, who showed that CODFs are
axiomatisable and thus are the model companion of ordered differential fields. I will give an introduction to CODFs and will then focus on
three topics:
1) Definable sets in CODFs
2) Constructions of CODFs
3) CODFs and dense pairs of real closed fields.
For proofs I will use some results from the talk of Omar Leon-Sanchez.

<a href="http://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~eleftheriou/tame/Vasilyev.pdf"> <b>SLIDES</b> </a>

<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b> This will be a brief review of the notion of dense/codense expansion of a geometric theory that we developed in a joint work with Alexander Berenstein, with a focus on G-structures in the context of algebraically closed and real closed fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>G-structures serve as an example of a dense/codense expansion that is "intermediate" between lovely pairs and H-structures. We will discuss similarities and differences between these three types of expansions, in particular, the effect that each expansion has on the algebraic closure operator, forking and NIP-like conditions.

Erik Walsberg (UIUC):</b> <i>Generically stable types in dense pairs of real closed fields</i>
<br><br> 

<b>Abstract:</b>  Let (R,&lt;,+,\cdot) be a real-closed field and K be a dense real closed subfield of R. It was shown by Nell that the additive and multiplicative quotients (R,+)/(R',+) and (R,\cdot)/(R',\cdot) contain canonical generically stable types. We discuss the question, posed by Minh Tran, of whether or not these types are orthogonal to each other.
